## What are the First Principle of Computing ?

One may think of following a logical thinking,ability to break bigger problems into smaller ones , ability to see the commonality between different approaches  etc as the first principles. However while each of those qualities are good imperatives, they hide a much more fundamental attitude of the mind. 
In a one word this is described in wikipedia as below:

"Intentions are mental states in which the agent commits themselves to a course of action. Having the plan to visit the zoo tomorrow is an example of an intention. The action plan is the content of the intention while the commitment is the attitude towards this content. Other mental states can have action plans as their content, as when one admires a plan, but differ from intentions since they do not involve a practical commitment to realizing this plan. Successful intentions bring about the intended course of action while unsuccessful intentions fail to do so. Intentions, like many other mental states, have intentionality: they represent possible states of affairs."

If we follow the coder's first steps in coding a piece of software ,it can be said with enough confidence that the intention the coder had definitely plays a part in the shape and content of code. This role of intention covers,not only coding but also everything human kind design and contribute to the real world. Inspite of this obvious truth there remains no standard way to represent 'Intention' in software such that it can help the current and future developers who want to continue developing the code over time.

## CONTEXtFLOW

Contextflow is a methodology and a protocol to develop software in small pieces that can be joined up through explicit intentions.
